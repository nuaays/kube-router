Kube-router is a distributed load balancer, firewall and router designed for Kubernetes networking with aim to provide operational simplicity and high performance.

## Primary Features

*kube-router does it all.*

With all features enabled, kube-router is a lean yet powerful alternative to
several network components used in typical Kubernetes clusters. All this from a
single DaemonSet/Binary. It doesn't get any easier.

### IPVS/LVS based service proxy | `--run-service-proxy`

kube-router uses the Linux kernel's IPVS features to implement its K8s Services
Proxy. This feature has been requested for some time in kube-proxy, but you can
have it right now with kube-router.

- [Kubernetes network services proxy with IPVS/LVS](https://cloudnativelabs.github.io/post/2017-05-10-kube-network-service-proxy/)
- [Kernel Load-Balancing for Docker Containers Using IPVS](https://blog.codeship.com/kernel-load-balancing-for-docker-containers-using-ipvs/)

### Pod Networking | `--run-router`

kube-router handles Pod networking efficiently with direct routing thanks to the
BGP protocol and the GoBGP Go library. It uses the native Kubernetes API to
maintain distributed pod networking state. That means no dependency on a
separate datastore to maintain in your cluster.

kube-router's elegant design also means there is no dependency on another CNI
plugin. The
[official "bridge" plugin](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/main/bridge)
provided by the CNI project is all you need -- and chances are you already have
it in your CNI binary directory!

### Network Policy Controller | `--run-firewall`

Enabling Kubernetes [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
is easy with kube-router -- just add a flag to kube-router. It uses ipsets with
iptables to ensure your firewall rules have as little performance impact on your
cluster as possible.

Kube-router supports the networking.k8s.io/NetworkPolicy API or network policy V1/GA
[semantics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39164#issue-197243974) and also network policy beta semantics.

### Advanced BGP Capabilities

If you have other networking devices or SDN systems that talk BGP, kube-router
will fit in perfectly. From a simple full node-to-node mesh to per-node peering
configurations, most routing needs can be attained. The configuration is
Kubernetes native (annotations) just like the rest of kube-router, so use the
tools you already know! Since kube-router uses GoBGP, you have access to a
modern BGP API platform as well right out of the box.

For more details please refer to the [BGP documentation](Documentation/bgp.md).

### Standard Linux Networking

A key design tenet of Kube-router is to use standard Linux networking stack and toolset. There is no overlays or 
SDN pixie dust, but just plain good old networking. You can use standard Linux networking tools like iptables, ipvsadm, ipset,
iproute, traceroute, tcpdump etc. to troubleshoot or observe data path. When kube-router is ran as a daemonset, image also ships with these [tools](./Documentation/pod-toolbox.md#pod-toolbox) automatically configured for your cluster.

### Small Footprint

Although it does the work of several of its peers in one binary, kube-router
does it all with a relatively [tiny codebase](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/tree/master/app/controllers), partly because IPVS is already
there on your Kuberneres nodes waiting to help you do amazing things.
kube-router brings that and GoBGP's modern BGP interface to you in an elegant
package designed from the ground up for Kubernetes.

### High Performance

A primary motivation for kube-router is performance. The combination of BGP for
inter-node Pod networking and IPVS for load balanced proxy Services is a perfect
recipe for high-performance cluster networking at scale. BGP ensures that the
data path is dynamic and efficient, and IPVS provides in-kernel load balancing
that has been thouroughly tested and optimized.
